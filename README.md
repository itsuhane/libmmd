libmmd
======

A MikuMikuDance Library in C++

**Obsoleted**: this version of `libmmd` has ended its purpose for many years.
There are occasional forks & stars which I feel great appreciate. But the design of `libmmd` was quite out-dated and was cumbersome for real-world usage. Hence, no more updates will happen and there will be no more documents coming up. Issue board will still open for any questions/discussions.
